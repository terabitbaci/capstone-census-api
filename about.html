            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Stats for Your County webpage accesses US census data to help users understand the population migration flow into and out of their community.</p>

            <p>This app show how each county in the U.S. fits into the migratory flows in the United States and worldwide. In this day where immigration is often the leading news story, it is helpful to see that migrations are a part of the American experience, that most communities are in flux, and that, for any given community, your new neighbors are of every origin and background.</p>
