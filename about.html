            <h2>About</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Stats for Your County website accesses US census data to help users understand the population migration flow into and out of their community. In this day when immigration is often the leading news story, it is helpful to see that migrations are a part of the American experience, that most counties are in flux, and that, for any given community, your new neighbors are of every origin and background. The data show how each county in the U.S. fits into the migratory flows in the United States and worldwide.</p><br>
            <h3>How data is collected</h3>
            <p>The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the American Community Survey (ACS) on an ongoing basis. Every month, the bureau sends questionnaires to nearly 300,000 randomly sampled addresses across America, including Puerto Rico, that contain questions ranging from age, sex and race, to broader topics such as social, economic and housing characteristics. This is an improvement over the previous model which collected data only every ten years. The ACS combines data from multiple years to produce reliable information at the county and neighborhood level.</p>
