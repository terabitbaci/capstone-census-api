## Introduction
Finding upcoming shows is as easy as a click of a search button but getting to a show can be a nightmare. Not only is parking impossible but it puts so many cars on the road and increases carbon emissions. With Upbeat Atlas I wanted to create an easy way for event goers to locate their next show with a Google map to easily find directions along with a gentle nudge to consider taking a more sustainable way.


## Use Case
Why is this app useful? Many event sites are loaded with information: tickets available, other acts and upcoming events, venue location etc. To get directions it requires copying and pasting the venue address or remembering the venue name to input into Google Maps. Upbeat Atlas simplifies that by just providing the venue name, date, and a pinpoint map to get directions. No more searching around for directions when getting those last minute directions.

## UX

Initial wireframes for Upbeat Atlas can be seen below. Wireframes of all key processes were designed along with data flow and user questions for key tasks.

The app is responsive and was designed to work on mobile, tablet and desktop screens. A friendly popup window appears as users search for artists as information loads to consider choosing a more sustainable travel option.
